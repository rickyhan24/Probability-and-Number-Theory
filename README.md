# Probability-and-Number-Theory

In this paper, I explore the probability distribution of the highest exponent of 2 that occurs in a set
of positive integers. I apply the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to determine whether or not the
distribution is binomial, poisson, or geometric. It is determined experimentally and analytically that
the distribution is geometric.
